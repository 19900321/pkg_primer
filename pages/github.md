title: Putting your R package on GitHub
---

- This page will be more motivational than instructional, but there's
  a bit of instruction at the end
- What is GitHub
- Why use version control
- Why put it on GitHub (issue tracking; pull requests; great GUI for
  exploring code; package easily accessible
  without CRAN using `install_github` in devtools)
- I use git and GitHub for everything now
  - software
  - data analysis projects
  - manuscripts
  - slides for talks
  - web sites
- Also consider BitBucket (unlimited private repositories; can use the
  mercurial version control system, if you prefer that; but not as
  many people using it and I don't like the GUI quite as much)
- Resources on Git and GitHub
- How to install a package from GitHub
- `Readme.md`, `.Rbuildignore`, and `.gitignore`

Now go to the page about [getting your R package on CRAN](pages/cran.html).
